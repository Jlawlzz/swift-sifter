And if you're missing me
You better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying

So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really, really hate that

Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying

So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
Just another picture to burn
Baby burn

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh ''cause it just so funny''
and I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause
